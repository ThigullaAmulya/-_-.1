The provided Java code implements an Online Reservation System that emulates the process of making train reservations. The system's core features include user authentication, reservation form submission, cancellation procedures, and data management. Upon execution, the code prompts users to input their login ID and password for authentication. The `isValidLogin` function verifies the entered credentials against predefined values ("amazon" and "flipcart"). Upon successful authentication, users are granted access to the main system; otherwise, an authentication failure message is displayed, leading to program termination.

Following authentication, the reservation form workflow commences. Users are prompted to input their fundamental details, such as name, address, phone number, preferred train number, class type, journey date, departure location, and destination. These inputs are acquired through the `Scanner` class and subsequently forwarded to the `insertReservation` function. A sample train name is generated via the `getTrainName` function. If the insertion of the reservation is successful (the function currently returns `true` as a placeholder), a success message is shown; otherwise, a message indicates the reservation's failure.

The cancellation process follows the reservation phase. Users can access the cancellation form and are asked to enter their PNR (Passenger Name Record) number. After entering the PNR, the `displayCancellationDetails` function is invoked to display pertinent cancellation-related information. Users are then prompted to confirm the cancellation by typing "yes" or "no." In the event of a "yes" confirmation, the `cancelReservation` function (currently returning `true` as a placeholder) is executed. Subsequently, a message indicates either a successful or failed cancellation.

Furthermore, the code contains methods to validate user input and manipulate data:
- `isValidLogin`: Validates user login credentials against predetermined values.
- `getTrainName`: Generates a sample train name based on the train number.
- `insertReservation`: Simulates the reservation insertion process and returns a success status.
- `displayCancellationDetails`: Presents cancellation details for a provided PNR number.
- `cancelReservation`: Simulates the cancellation process and returns a success status.

The `main` function serves as the central orchestrator, capturing user input through the `Scanner` class, coordinating interactions with the various methods, and displaying appropriate messages based on the user's actions. It is important to note that this code is designed for illustrative purposes and does not interact with actual databases or perform genuine reservation and cancellation operations. It offers a foundational framework for creating an online reservation system, which can be expanded with real database integrations, enhanced user interfaces, and more sophisticated functionalities.
